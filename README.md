Hi!, I will tell you a little about myself:ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andres Ortiz :boy: , and my nationality is Colombian, I am a Developer, thanks to the MisionTic 2022 program I received a programmer's degree with an emphasis on Web Application Development at the National University, however I had already been preparing myself before with numerous paid courses and free on the internet, in addition to that I have carried out projects independently through my own company, although this one focuses more on Accounting-Administration since the first career I did was Public Accounting at the University of Cundinamarca. I love the Python and JavaScript languages, however, professionally I have had more approaches with Java. During my training process I have sponsored people to continue on this path, since it is a fantastic world and it serves for constant global growth. Although I have knowledge in languages like; Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, metalanguages; HTML, CSS, databases; MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, plus hosting and version control using Git; Bitbucket, Heroku, GitHub, with related experience in test and process automation projects using Selenium in Python, web development using frameworks; Angular, Django, Symphony, Vue. Js, in addition to CRUD applications in Python and Java, use of IDEs such as; Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and NetBeans, I'm still learning and I consider myself a novice, with a lot of desire to become someone very good in the IT sector. The public repositories that I have are very basic but soon I will leave several of my personal projects on view and I will invite you to know some of which I do not assemble the code but the process.
